This project relies on a 3rd party library: [HCGStudio.DistributionChecker](https://github.com/HCGStudio/DistributionChecker)

We are currently using a [modified version](https://github.com/prtnio/DistributionChecker/tree/main) of this library. The [proposed change](https://github.com/HCGStudio/DistributionChecker/pull/1) has not been merged in the upstream. As for now please add `https://nuget.pkg.github.com/prtnio/index.json` to your NuGet package source.
